The word “Corona” or “COVID- 19” has been engraved into the minds of people around the world. 
The sudden outbreak of this impactful disease has led to thousands of deaths nationwide, economic shutdowns, 
and other various tragedies. This pandemic is so newly born, and there is so much that the world has yet to discover. 
As of now, everyone in the world istrying to take safety precautions and doing everything in their power to prevent the spread of this contagious disease. 
In these unprecedented times, it is imperative that people understand how susceptible they are to the virus. 
This would allow individuals to limit their actions and exposure to various situations involving COVID-19. 
Since there is so much uncertainty regarding the transmission and symptoms of the virus, 
we as a team wanted to develop a COVID-19 risk calculator that would help people understand their mortality risk due to COVID-19 based on various factors. 
To accomplish this, we broke down the different underlying factors that may have an influence on humans dying from COVID-19.
These included race, age, gender, location, and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). 
Race played a role due to the fact that it guaranteed that all ethnicities and races had an equal chance of being affected by the pandemic. 
There are towns and neighborhoods that have a majority of one race and may not have access to healthcare supplies. 
Age was chosen as a factor, since people of older age seemed to be far more vulnerable to dying from the disease due to the fragility of the body's health.
Gender was a factor that was included to differentiate whether males or females had a higher chance of getting the disease. 
Population density or the compliance of people in a certain area may cause the spike of COVID-19 cases in one state compared to another,
which is why the location factor was included in our risk calculator and research. The NPIs were then considered as the final major factor. 
It was very important to account for the levels of precaution various states were taking. This included how well states practiced social distancing,
whether people were wearing masks, etc. With these differentiating factors, a COVID-19 risk calculator was created to prevent and inform people on how likely 
they were to die from this newborn virus.
